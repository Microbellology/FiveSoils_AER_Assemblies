Here I am trying to map my raw read to the taxa that are in Henry's list but are missing from my list of bins. 

I map to representative genomes of each taxonomic group that are pulled from gtdb

Once I have all the reads that map I try to assemble them with the aim of getting some MAGs that were missing, even if they are low quality

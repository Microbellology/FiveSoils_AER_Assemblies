I need to make a coverage profile of all the bins I have so far.
I have used polished bins. This may defeat the purpose of looking at all bins,
as, polished bins have a quality check before hand. I may need to go back and look
at the bins that did not pass this quality check

whilst I make this coverage profile and an overview of my whole project I also need to
continue working on mapping to the selected fasta files. I also need to make that fasta file

Make coverage profile of all bins
have gtdb and checkM results for those also

map to missing taxa

finish power point

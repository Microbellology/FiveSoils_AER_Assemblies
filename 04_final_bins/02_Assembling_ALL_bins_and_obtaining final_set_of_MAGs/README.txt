In the past I have only used the polished bins from the hybrid assemblies I've done in the past (both with and without musa reads). 

Here I combine the polished bins, the unpolished bins and the short reads assemblies all into one

I use dRep without the qc. 

The aim is to pick up some species that are in Henry's list but are missing from my bin list.
